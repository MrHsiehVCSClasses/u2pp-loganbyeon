# Unit 2 Programming Project
This Sanrio character project allows the user to input certain information to make their own custom character which really does nothing lol.   
Start by running the code. A question should appear in the terminal to which the user should input an answer.  
After inputting all answers to the questions to create a character, the user can select one of the two default characters: My Melody or Kuromi.    
When the user selects either one of the default characters, they can learn a super duper unique fact about them.  
It's pretty lame but this is what I can do..
shout-out to my coder brother for helping me :D
